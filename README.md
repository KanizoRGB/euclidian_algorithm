# Euclidian_algorithm
The Euclidean algorithm is a fundamental method in mathematics with various applications, especially in number theory, algebra, and computer science.
It is usefuful in cryptographic situations where the numbers often have several hundreds of digits and are hard to factor.
In Cryptography, it offers some of the following advantages

## 1. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculation
* Primary Use:
The Euclidean algorithm is used to efficiently compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The GCD is the largest number that divides both integers without leaving a remainder.

* Importance:
Knowing the GCD is crucial in simplifying fractions, solving Diophantine equations, and dealing with ratios.

## 2. Efficiency and Simplicity
* Efficiency:
The Euclidean algorithm is much faster than the direct method of factoring both numbers to find their GCD. It reduces the problem size iteratively, making it highly efficient for large numbers.

* Simplicity:
The algorithm uses only division and modulus operations, making it simple and easy to implement in computer programs or by hand.

## 3. Basis for More Advanced Algorithms
* Extended Euclidian Algorithm:
This extension not only finds the GCD but also finds integers $x$ and $y$ such that $a.x + b.y = GCD(a,b)$. This is crucial in many applications, including solving linear Diophantine equations and cryptography

* Modern Cryptography:
The algorithm plays a role in algorithms like RSA encryption, which rely on properties of numbers such as coprimeness (when GCD is 1) and modular arithmetic.
